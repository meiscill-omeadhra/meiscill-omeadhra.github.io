</p><h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>

	<center><blockquote><i><b>
"... a large planet stood above the<br> 
North Pole for a very long time."</b></i></blockquote></center>

<p>That is what all the mythology throughout the world uniformly states --
mythology from every nation, region, tribe, and period, in thousands of
languages, in hundreds of forms, from every continent -- they all resound,
"a large planet stood above the North Pole for a very long time."  Every
country, that is, except those more than 10 degrees below the equator.

</p><p>The mythology of regions as far removed from each other as Siberia,
North Africa, and Guatemala all agree. If the mythology is true (and what
other conclusion could be drawn), then the fact that a large planet stood
at the northern horizon is true. How this could be, is a matter which this
text will attempt to address.

</p><p>As others have also done, I will suggest that this
planet was Saturn.
From other sources we can estimate that the planet Saturn moved on a
wildly elliptical path around the Sun in the remote past, entering the
Solar System at very long intervals. Some time in the last 3 million
years, perhaps after passing Jupiter, Saturn was drawn into a much closer
orbit around the Sun, very near Earth. And from 10,900 BC, Saturn captured
and held the Earth in a sub-polar position lasting until 3147 BC, when
Earth broke away.
</p>
<p class="pagebreak"></p>

        <blockquote><i>"You cannot reason a person out of a position<br>
	he did not reason himself into in the first place."</i><p> --
        Jonathan Swift </p></blockquote>

<p> This is, however, exactly what I will attempt to do with this text: I
will try to tell the actual history of the world and humanity -- in spite
of the knee-jerk reactions and spitting noises you may see and hear from
those who feel they know better. This is not my story, but the efforts of
a great many people, and based on evidence in plain view.

</p><p>My starting point is the postulate that myths throughout the world
should be taken at face value. For the recurring worldwide mythology this
is almost completely obvious. No other form of meaning can be assigned.

</p><p> An attempt to apply local culture and limitations to mythology almost
always meets with failure because of a lack of appreciation of the
constant refrain of identical themes by peoples who have remained
completely foreign to each other -- who have never had cultural contact.
Any theory of mythology based on limited and local origins will fail to
translate to the hundreds of additional instances across the world. This
holds true also for all the variations of analogies that are presented to
us as explanations of mythology: notions of ritual, model behavior,
allegories of nature, personifications of the weather.

</p><p> This leaves only the historicity of mythology. It has an evidential
character which is absolute. If myth tells us that a large planet stood
above the northern horizon, then we are stuck with this as fact. It cannot
be negated, waived aside, or turned into an allegory. It only remains to
investigate how this could have been so. Mythology is history.

</p><p>Of course it is not always astoundingly clear. Frequently we are met
with wording which is no longer understood, and frequently it will be
easier for us to elicit metaphors from our own culture and language in an
attempt to explain the inexplicable. This is probably the most frequently
made mistake in investigating mythology.

</p><p> Mythology represents a history stretching into the depths of time. On
the other hand, the accepted mainstream history is a 2000-year record of
rewriting and softening of facts, created for the sake of sanity and the
comfort of your soul. It is a history of the survivors, written to cover
their suspicions and allay any fears. It was initiated with the scrutiny
of myths by Plato, and has grown since the Renaissance, culminating in the
scientificism of the last hundred years. If the narrative based on
conventional wisdom suits you, you should stop reading here, for the story
presented here will get progressively stranger.  Be comforted, though,
that this will not be about crashing meteors, undetected planets, or
visits by aliens.

</p><p> The story of what has happened to Earth has no plot and no direction,
and makes no sense. This is, in fact, one of the basic parameters of myth:
there is no encompassing teleological design, it does not teach, it does
not glorify, it does not propose any new arcane knowledge. It only
recounts the past.

</p><p>Returning now to that large object in the sky: 

        </p><blockquote><i>"The evidence of myth which points to Saturn having
once occupied a position above Earth's north polar regions is voluminous.
There is not a race on Earth that has not preserved at least one account
which states as much. According to this evidence, Saturn occupied a
central position in the north celestial regions. It rotated, and rotated
widely; but other than that, it was immovable.</i>
<p>-- Dwardu Cardona (1978) 
 <a href="#lost-fn1">[note&nbsp;1]</a><a name="lost-1"></a></p></blockquote>

<p>It rotated, in fact, in a circle around the polar axis. From a vantage
point 15 to 20 degrees of latitude further south than Mesopotamia and
Egypt, the Guatemalan <i>Popol Vuh</i> recounts that it rose out of an
ocean and sank back into it every day for what appears to have been some
2500 years starting 10,900 BC. 

<a name="lost-s0"></a>
</p><h2 align="center">What This Site Is Really About</h2>

<p>This is a cosmology. It is not the traditional handed-down narrative
passed off as the history of everything. It is an alternative -- one which
is very extensive -- quite complete and accurate. My starting premise was
to hold worldwide mythology as absolute and believable, although at times
very obscure. My method subsequent to this starting position was the
collection of myths and iconography, and then to develop, in turn, a
chronology of events (Appendix A) and a likely process of celestial
mechanics (Appendix B). At that point I started a narrative.

</p><p> As an alternative cosmology the narrative has remained within the
accepted boundaries of physics and dating. This has continued to surprise
me as the details developed. I have had no problem with the integration of
the iconography, the odd events, and the obscure mythological phrasings.
Other alternative cosmologies have had to resort to analogical and
metaphorical readings of the past, or suggest improbable exploding
bolides.

</p><p> In the realm of orthodox cosmology, since 2007 we are seeing
astrophysicists, atomic physicists, and archaeologists doing exactly that
-- that is, suggesting improbable exploding bolides in attempts to explain
an event in 10,900 BC which caused the complete destruction of all the
megafauna of the North American continent, plus an absolutely stupendous
conflagration which vaporized everything organic and melted rocks. To
explain these data, published papers have alternately posited an influx of
meteors, aerially exploding iceballs from space, the propagation of
flaming shockwaves from kinetic energy conversion in the air (even though
there is no such thing), and the influx of atomic particles from a
supernova. The establishment scientists are lost, and by their own
admission they are grasping at straws.

</p><p> But there is a straightforward answer. It lies in the predictable
effects of repulsive electric force between planets when their
plasmaspheres touch, that is, line up with each other. And this is what I
will propose, even though you are very unlikely to be in the least
familiar with this.

</p><p> This is so because for some almost inexplicable reason, such forces
and such interactions cannot be conceived of or even discussed within the
realm of consensus science, especially in astrophysics, despite the fact
that electric fields have been the stock of electrical engineering since
the early 19th century. Ralph Juergens wrote in 1972:

        </p><blockquote><i>"When the moment arrived for the inevitable
encounter </i>[between plasmaspheres], [the]<i> sheaths would make
contact.  Unleashed electric fields would clash.  Almost instantly, forces
immeasurably greater than gravitation would be brought to bear on the
charged bodies. Cosmic thunderbolts would flash between the bodies in an
effort to equalize their electric potentials."</i><p> -- "Reconciling
Celestial Mechanics and Velikovskian Catastrophism" (<i>Pensee</i> 1972)
</p></blockquote>

<p>The forces "immeasurably greater than gravitation" are real. They are
electrically repulsive, billions on billions of times stronger than
gravity, and they operate instantaneously (not "almost instantly"). The
effects do not last long, for a charge of the opposite polarity would
quickly be induced. After a delay (perhaps of minutes) the "cosmic
thunderbolts" would follow -- a charge equalization. Since this is the
movement of electrons and protons across space it will involve a travel
time delay.

</p><p>Juergens continues with:

        </p><blockquote><i>"The list of unthinkably disastrous effects that
would result could go on and on.  The point to be made, however, is that
</i>Worlds in Collision<i> </i>[Immanuel Velikovsky's book]<i> -- at least
in my opinion -- documents historical evidence to indicate that phenomena
associated with space-charge sheath destruction were actually suffered and
survived by peoples of antiquity."</i></blockquote>

<p> The repulsive force between planets with like charges (or attractive
force for unlike charges)  is about 39 orders of magnitude greater than
the attractive force due to gravity -- thus it is greater than gravity by
a factor (a multiplier) of 10 to the 39th power -- 10 followed by 39
zeros. Gravity drops off with the square of the separation distance. That
is also true for point electric charges, but for charged surfaces the
force drops off as the inverse of the separation distance.

</p><p> It is here taken for granted that all Solar System planets carry an
extremely high negative charge -- at their surface (or in the near-space
region). This has been known for Earth for a long time, but this awareness
is only slowly creeping into the field of celestial mechanics. The planets
keep electrically isolated from each other by means of their enclosing
plasmasphere (what Juergens called a space-charge sheath above) which for
Earth is approximately equal to the Earth's magnetosphere (thus with a
radius generally 20 times the diameter of the Earth). For comets this is
called the coma.

</p><p>In popular mainstream astrophysics the "plasmasphere" is
frequently represented as consisting only of the Van Allen belts, an
equatorial toroidal region of charged particles surrounding the Earth.
The visible comas and tails of comets contradicts this, as does the
analysis of the electrical properties of the space surrounding the Earth
which is based on satellite measurements. See for example J. H. Piddington
<i>Cosmic Electrodynamics</i> (1969) and others.

</p><p>It is absolutely astounding that, in the 40 years since 1972, not one
author among the writers in catastrophism has taken proper account of the
repulsive forces Juergens first introduced into the literature.

</p><p> I should point out also, that when Juergens writes "almost instantly
forces immeasurable larger" and "cosmic thunderbolts would flash between
the bodies," most readers fail to realize that there is a delay between
these two separate actions. It seems to have been universally assumed that
the thunderbolts result instantaneously from sensing a difference in
potential, perhaps because one sentence follows directly on the other.  

</p><p> The difference in potential which causes the "cosmic thunderbolt" does
not exist until an opposite charge is induced at one of the planets (which
takes time) and the thunderbolt is further delayed by the time it takes
for electrons and ions to travel from one planet to the other.  And I
should also point out that interplanetary lightning strikes are almost
benign compared to the destructive interaction due to the <i>likeness</i>
in potential -- the electric repulsive forces.

</p><p>What is perhaps more astounding is the sheer lunacy of Velikovskian
researchers, almost none of whom had the slightest background in physics
or engineering, in insisting, for a span of thirty or forty years (as did
Velikovsky), that somehow an interaction of magnetic fields between
planets would account for changes in the Earth's orbit and Earth's axial
inclination -- despite the fact that the two planets accused of
interfering with Earth, Venus and Mars, have no magnetic field.

</p><p> Much of this was due to Velikovsky's insistence on the primacy of
magnetic fields while ignoring electric fields. Magnetic fields remained
in the conceptual foreground as long as it was thought that the planetary
interaction genuinely involved "collisions" or "near collisions." Everyone
has played with magnets and understands their effectiveness at close
distances.  Almost no one has any feel for the enormous wallop packed by
electric charges at great distances.

</p><p>As I have discovered over and over again, the theorists (mostly "story
tellers") of the catastrophic events first proposed by Velikovsky have
seldom given much thought to the obvious: Venus could not have made a
close approach to Earth without overall destruction of both planets.

</p><p> The retellers of Velikovsky's narratives have held his book as Bible
truth, for a number of reasons: in order to remain in his good graces,
from a deficiency of imagination, and from the complete lack of knowledge
of physics and electricity. There has been a whole generation of
"researchers" who have never given a single thought to alternate scenarios
which would generate the same descriptions from antiquity.

</p><p> This is so like the established mainstream notions of today's science
orthodoxy, which holds that things always were as they are today. No other
condition can enter the imagination and certainly cannot present itself as
fact. Yet all indications from the recent past are that things were
different. Even very recently the arrangement of the Solar System differed
markedly from today.

</p><p> What is most important about the changes in the arrangement of the
Solar System, many of which were catastrophic, is the cultural and
psychological reaction of the people of Earth to these events. The last
1000 years of the period when Saturn visually stood above the north
horizon (4077 BC to 3147 BC) were beneficial and was remembered as the
"Era of the Gods." Subsequent human history has been a singular effort to
regain that Paradise. This period was followed by a series of adjustments
in planetary orbits, some of which also had significant destructive
effects on Earth and traumatic psychological effects on humans.

</p><p> Humans changed after Paradise closed in 3147 BC. It was not just the
rapid changes which we identify as civilization since 3147 BC, but also
the acquisition, over the next three millennia, of subjective
consciousness. The response to catastrophic events determined how we
became fully human. To say it would have happened anyway does not hold up.
There could have been any number of other outcomes. We could still be
chipping flints. After all, we did that for more than a million years.

<a name="lost-s4"></a>
</p><h2 align="center">Disbelieving History</h2>

<p> Of course, many will disbelieve and deride the concept of an
alternative history, for it was not learned at their mother's knee. Most
people have never actually tested the logic of the mainstream scenarios.
The orthodoxy just "feels so right," because it is promulgated by a
consensus of the established community of scientists, and especially by
astronomers and historians. These two disciplines, it should be pointed
out, operate without a physical object they can lay their hands on and are
thus relegated to considering their subject of study mostly within the
vacuum of the mind.

</p><p> The physicality and history presented by the establishment is so here
and now: it is everywhere and as accepted as religion (and with as little
basis in fact). Any alternative to the conventional cosmology is thought
to be impossible.

</p><p>So, if you need to ask me: none of the information presented here has
been published as scientific opinions in peer-reviewed professional
journals. There are no clinical trials underway.  My readers either
understand and agree or they maintain an absolute silence. Over the last
fifteen years I have only been faulted once -- for my claim that mountains
existed before the Biblical flood of Noah.

</p><p> Ralph Juergens, in 1972, in a brief evaluation of reasons for the
"emotional outburst from the community of astronomers" (in particular) to
the writings of Immanuel Velikovsky, wrote in summary about the scientific
community:

        </p><blockquote><i>"... I believe it is only fair to acknowledge an
underlying and totally sincere scientific disbelief in the historical
record."</i><br></blockquote>

<p> Juergens here plainly translates <i>mythology</i> to <i>history</i>,
as I do. Let's face the facts: the major portion of the historical
record of mankind is our mythology. But this is not how most people
understand mythology, including, or perhaps especially so, the scientific
community.

</p><p> To most people mythology is an exercise in didactic preachings on
ethics and morals, akin to religious education. This represents an
attitude initiated with the skepticism of Plato, and most recently
reinforced by Joseph Campbell with his 1949 book <i>The Hero of a Thousand
Faces</i>.

</p><p> To Campbell myths are universal truths presented in symbolic language.
But to everyone else myths are insubstantial and unreal. They have no
relationship to anything in the physical world, and quoting the fanciful
language of ancient sages doesn't prove anything about the real world of
astronomers and physicists.

</p><p>But it may be more than that. It is, in fact, difficult to understand
the violent reaction to Velikovsky and his book as being solely based on a
disbelief in history or in misconceptions about mythology. The reaction
that was evoked primarily seemed to consist of predictable psychological
defenses to perceived attacks. The astronomers had been bested by an
outsider.

<a name="lost-s1"></a>
</p><h2 align="center">The History of Objections</h2>

<p>Efforts to debunk the cosmologies proposed by Immanuel Velikovsky
(<i>Worlds in Collision</i> published in 1950), as well as David Talbott
(<i>The Saturn Myth</i> of 1980), and work by Wallace Thornhill, Don
Scott, and others have continued unabated for 60 years by those who need
to convince themselves that they live in a stable Universe where things
have always been as they are today.

</p><p> Even recently, in 2012, more books are being published which are
intended to show the terrifying influence of Velikovsky, such as Michael
Gordin's <i>The Pseudoscience Wars and the Birth of the Modern Fringe</i>.
Gordin equates Velikovsky's writing (as the publication blurb announces)
with "other fringe doctrines, including creationism, parapsychology, and
more."

</p><p>Another book, Laird Scranton's <i>The Velikovsky Heresies: Worlds in
Collision and Ancient Catastrophes Revisited</i>, supports Velikovsky, but
with little effort at an in-depth analysis. Most of the writing simply
rehashes the favorable reviews of the 1960's.

</p><p> Whereas Velikovsky's <i>Worlds in Collision</i> is listed under
"Astronomy and Astrophysics" at Amazon.com, the above books are listed
under "Religion and Spirituality" and "Christian Books and Bibles." As
ever, the ability to influence religion is the greatest fear.

</p><p> Today it is absolutely taboo to cite the work of Velikovsky in any
scientific papers.  This is observed with a religious zeal.  Alfred de
Grazia suggests it is a symptom of "collective neurosis" among astronomers
and especially among archaeologists. Archaeology deals with actual objects
but derived time periods. Velikovsky's later theory of displaced
archaeological dates was very threatening. The violent rejection and
debunking by professionals, whether they be astronomers, historians, or
linguists, is perhaps the best certification of the very likely veracity
of new ideas.

<a name="lost-s5"></a>
</p><h2 align="center">The AAAS and the Heretic</h2>

<p>I should add an additional note on Velikovsky, since people tend to
hold pre-formed opinions of him which are derived from rather scurrilous
condemnations by the scientific community, in fact, almost entirely due to
a symposium held by the <i>American Association for the Advancement of
Science</i> in 1974 -- twenty four years after publication of Velikovsky's
book <i>Worlds in Collision</i>.

</p><p> The symposium was presented as the ultimate excommunication of
Velikovsky in a trial of scientificisms performed by the AAAS. Velikovsky
was on a panel with five scientists who were to consider his ideas. He was
allowed to speak for 30 minutes, but was then followed by four
anti-Velikovsky panelists who spoke against his ideas for two hours. The
press loved it, extravagantly quoted Carl Sagan, and held Sagan as the
winner.

</p><p>At the time of the symposium, 24 years after his first publication, all
too many predictions and corollaries formed by Velikovsky had been
verified, based mainly on data gathered from the space program. Meanwhile
Velikovsky had been giving standing-room-only lectures at universities and
had become an embarrassment to astronomy.

</p><p>James Hogan, in <i>Kicking the Sacred Cow</i> (2004), writes:

        </p><blockquote><i>"Organized science had tried every tactic of
distortion, evasion, misrepresentation, intimidation, vilification, and
suppression of evidence to slay the monster that threatened the entire
foundation of the collective uniformitarian world-view and mind-set.</i> 
</blockquote>

<p> Hogan is not exaggerating. As he mentions: 

	</p><blockquote><i>... after twenty years, interest in Velikovsky's
theories was not only getting stronger with the apparent vindication from
all quarters that was getting past the censorship and receiving coverage,
but Velikovsky was no longer virtually alone. Scientists from many
disciplines were beginning to organize in his defense, bringing the
message to a new generation of readers and students."</i></blockquote>

<p>But the AAAS symposium would bring all of that to an end. I won't go
into details. You may readily find them. The end result was a disaster
for Velikovsky's reputation.  

</p><p> The AAAS printed up the proceedings, but without allowing responses
from Velikovsky.  The papers of the 1974 AAAS conference appeared in
Donald W. Goldsmith, <i>Scientists Confront Velikovsky</i> (1977).

</p><p>The introduction by Isaac Asimov begins with, "What does one do with a
heretic?" Indeed! Asimov's essay goes on to suggest that miracles by God
are a more likely solution to the catastrophes recorded in the Bible: "the
hypothesis that divine intervention caused the miracles." 

</p><p> In later recollections by Sagan in <i>Broca's Brain</i> (1979),
however unbelievably, the television-personality astronomer accused
Velikovsky of religious delusions: "Velikovsky attempts to rescue not only
religion but also astrology."

</p><p> Although presented as ridicule, that statement incorporates the hidden
fear of the astronomers and scientists: that Velikovsky's book was an
effort to tie science and astronomy to Bible fundamentalism -- just when
the scientists had thought they had rescued humanity from such blundering
behavior and superstitions. As Robert McAulay wrote in "Extra-Scientific
Dimensions of Science" (<i>Society for Interdisciplinary Studies (SIS)
Review</i>, 1979):

	</p><blockquote><i>"Velikovsky can be further comprehended. Of special
significance is the fact that Velikovsky's catastrophism is seen by a
number of eminent scientists as raising once more the spectre of the
arch-nemesis of modern science: Christian fundamentalism."</i>
</blockquote>

<p> Of any number of analyses I have read of the controversy surrounding
Velikovsky, only those that give voice to the idea that, inadvertently or
not, Velikovsky was supplying evidence in support of Bible fundamentalism,
made sense -- and this despite the fact that Velikovsky was an atheist and
basically anti-religious. But nevertheless fundamentalist ideas were
being read into his work.

	</p><blockquote><i>"Perhaps the key factor is that Velikovsky's
theories are regularly linked with literal interpretations of the Bible,
and are thus viewed as being of one piece with 'fundamentalism,' rather
than as an historical use of the Bible and other
sources."</i></blockquote>

<p>McAulay continues:

	</p><blockquote><i>"Along these lines, the number of times that
scientists refer to the religious implications of Velikovsky's work is
striking."</i></blockquote>

<p>What is happening here? I think we are seeing such violent reactions to
Velikovsky because the real reason for being so upset with him was to be
kept secret and hidden. It was a reaction to the invalidation of the
life's work of the scientists. Let me quote Edward T. Hall who, in
<i>Beyond Culture</i> (1976), sums up the reaction to telling people that
their world is misconceived:

        </p><blockquote><i>"When other people call attention to ... perceptual
differences, suggesting that the world is not as one perceives it, these
observations can be unsettling. To do so is to suggest that a person is
incompetent, not properly motivated, ignorant, or even infantile."</i>
</blockquote>

<p>This is exactly what Velikovsky's <i>Worlds in Collision</i> did to the
astronomers of the USA. The unspoken implications were that they were
incompetent and ignorant, and they were being told so by an outsider.

</p><p> Many wrote also about the AAAS exercise in exorcism. Lynn Rose, who
was present at the symposium, but not allowed to comment, produced
articles in <i>Kronos</i>, "Just Plainly Wrong," in 1977 and 1978.

</p><p> Charles Ginenthal spent nearly a decade researching <i>Carl Sagan and
Immanuel Velikovsky</i> (1995), which took up Sagan's points of
disagreement with Velikovsky.

</p><p> Alfred de Grazia authored, with Ralph Juergens and Livio Stecchini,
<i>The Velikovsky Affair</i> (1966, 1978), including an update for the
AAAS Symposium experiences.
 <a href="#lost-fn3">[note&nbsp;3]</a><a name="lost-3"></a>

</p><p> But all to no avail. There is no right and wrong in any of this, there
is nothing to prove. My feeling is that the participation by Velikovsky in
the symposium was a mistake which backfired by producing astoundingly bad
press. It was the single largest mistake that Velikovsky and his
supporters ever made, and perhaps the only one. Nothing will ever be
proven through debate of theories.

</p><p> There is no decisive proof to be had. The establishment owns a
complete culture of empty fictions -- the Big Bang, Black Holes, Dark
Matter, the Dark Ages of Greece, Sothic dating, and the pretentious
paradigm of Absolute Gradualism. None of it is real, yet all of it is
accepted as Gospel Truth. What the Velikovskians needed was marketing by
professionals -- not some self-generated precepts of decisive proof of
their theories. As de Grazia noted, in <i>Cosmic Heretics</i> (1984):

	</p><blockquote><i>"The practice of advancing priorities is childish
and the idea of proving a general cosmogony by a race of claims is
ludicrous. There can be no crucial test or event."</i></blockquote>

<p> Almost the complete series of objections presented by Wikipedia today
is in error or is of no current import. While many of the initial
celestial suppositions of Velikovsky have proven to be wrong, his
corollaries have been correct, despite the fact that in the 1950s the
astronomical establishment absolutely railed against them.

</p><p>One outstanding and contrary element, from Wikipedia, however, is the
following:

	</p><blockquote><i>"He proposed that electromagnetic forces could be
the cause of the movement of the planets, although such forces between
astronomical bodies are essentially zero."</i></blockquote>

<p> These forces are, in fact, zero, and will remain hidden and inactive
within the shielding plasmaspheres of the planets. However, if the
plasmaspheres of planets of nearly equal surface potentials intersect,
then the forces are absolutely stupendous, so much so that even today many
catastrophists shun all mention of repulsive forces between planets, for,
without a grounding in electric field theory, it simply cannot be
imagined how these forces act or how large they could be. They are, in
fact, billions on billions of times greater than gravitational forces.
This was how Venus "collided" with Earth at a distance of 20,000,000
miles (32,200,000 km).

</p><p> I would never have made any sense of any of this were it not for
the elucidation provided by the writings of Ralph Juergens, Wal Thornhill,
and Don Scott, which readily explain virtually all the planetary
interactions in electrical terms. Additionally, the mythological aspects
of my model developed out of writings and theories developed by David
Talbott and Julian Jaynes, to whom I am also greatly indebted.

 </p><h2 align="center">Validation</h2>

<p> I have done little more than connect the details of research by
others, which I reference in these first chapters. As a result, very
little
of the following essay is speculative. Almost all of it can be backed up
with currently available data and the theories of "Cosmic
Electrodynamics." This last is otherwise known as plasma theory, which is
based on long-standing concepts in electricity and field theory, and data
gathered with space probes. But don't worry, I'll keep it simple.

</p><p> Any speculation will be identified as such. More will be based on
common sense and intuition. I'll detail my methods in a later chapter.

</p><p> There have been numerous changes to this text, for many facets of the
past have only slowly revealed themselves over the span of the last 10
years. But the changes are almost all in details. The overall narrative
has remained the same since 2003.

</p><p> Last, the reader will be looking for proof of my claims. Proof of
specific ideas is at times overwhelming and at other times very sparse.
But the strongest indication for the validity of the overall claims made
here lies in the fact that the complete set of ideas explains almost all
mythology with great ease, including many concepts which have remained
entirely obscured under uniformitarian consensus and even ideas which have
remained inexplicable to alternative cosmologists despite years of
investigations.

</p><p> The Velikovskian studies have generated a number of magazines over the
years, from 1972 through to today. Much of this is available as a CDROM at
<a href="http://www.catastrophism.com/"> [www.catastrophism.com]</a> of
texts from past issues of <i>Pensee</i>, <i>Kronos</i>, <i>SIS Review</i>,
<i>SIS Workshop</i>, <i>Horus</i>, <i>Aeon</i>, <i>Velikovskian</i>, and
<i>Thoth</i> (with the last also at <a href="http://othergroup.net/thoth/"> [othergroup.net/thoth/]</a>. There
are over 4000 published articles directly concerned with these topics (and
another 10,000 as news reports and uninformed drivel).

</p><p> Most of these magazines have gone under. Only the Society for
Interdisciplinary Studies (SIS) publications have been added to the CDROM
as updates. The CDROM is perpetually out of date, and much of the graphics
are missing. Why all of this information is being hoarded is curious. It
should be freely made available on the internet as the most important and
intellectually liberating concepts to have been developed in the last 1000
years.

</p><p>In this essay I am providing no more than cursory information on what
has already been written about extensively by others. I have limited
references to their work because there is no reason to weigh down a
narrative with thousands of "op cit" and "ibid" footnotes -- which are too
unrevealing and foster the decontexualization of primary sources.

</p><p> Therefore, I did not include sources for most of the information in
this text since all I am doing is remapping areas already explored by
others and all of it is readily available, although scattered over many
sites and books.

</p><p> On the other hand, what is missing from the wide-ranging efforts of
other researchers is a coherent analysis of Mesoamerican sources. I have
added this. But it could not have been done without the prior exposition,
by others, of the sequence of events as described in Egyptian,
Mesopotamian, Indian, and Chinese sources. I am also indebted to earlier
commentators and chronographers from Augustine to Ussher.

</p><p> This site is thus in a large part a collation and synthesis of the
efforts of many other people to recoup the past and a restatement of their
work. Most of the information has been published previously, although I
could not accept all of the writings. A portion of these prior resources
is conjectural when based on unsound chronology, impractical when based on
poorly understood physics, and pure fantasy when based on analogies.

</p><p> And thus, in an attempt to put it all together, I am providing a
narrative text of findings which I feel are acceptable and adding what I
feel is missing: a sound chronology, realistic mechanics, and an
extrapolation to events not recognized by many researchers.

</p><p> I collected available material and put it in order, and, when it no
longer made sense, started writing.  Overall, the construction of a
cohesive narrative resolved every significant outstanding "problem" which
other researchers had run into, although at times it took months to find a
solution -- however obvious it eventually turned out to be.

</p><p> I should warn that the subject matter here is not any sort of accepted
science narrative. It is a cosmology based on a set of reasonable starting
postulates. The postulates, like those of any cosmology, are untestable.
However, established theories of physics can be applied to these and this
results in an amazing concordance of information in agreement with the
initial postulates, historical recollections, and observable facts. It is
this which confers validity on the explication pursued here. It suggests
sensible answers to questions about the history of mankind, the Earth, the
Solar System, and the Universe which have remained completely unanswered
by the traditional "handed-down wisdom." The sum total of the conclusions
derived here goes much further to constitute a cohesive "world-view" than
traditional opinions and narratives have done.

</p><p> This website takes Velikovsky's groundbreaking work, his book
<i>Worlds in Collision</i> (1950), as a starting point for the development
of a history of antiquity which answers more questions than any other
alternative cosmology, and certainly more than the commonly accepted
uniformitarian cosmology.

</p><p>Many catastrophists still accept Velikovsky's ideas. Others, such as
David Talbott, Wall Thornhill, and Dwardu Cardona of the Thunderbolts
group, hold that nothing ever happened after the so-called Polar
Configuration came apart in 3147 BC: not with Venus in 1500 BC or with
Mars after 800 BC. Considering (as I do) the huge assembly of mythology
which recounts these events, spread over three continents, with
Mesoamerica detailing this with identifiable dates, I am astounded at the
oversight.  What else could be expected as the winding down of the
cataclysm of 3147 BC with the removal of Saturn except further adjustments
and interactions of the loosened planets?

</p><p>I also came to the conclusion that some very large aspects of the past
-- including some immense events -- had been overlooked by some of the
most able researchers. I discovered and detailed the fall of the Absu in
2349 BC and the resurrection of Jupiter, and discovered the blazing of
Venus and Mercury in 685 BC and the plasmoid delivered from Jupiter to the
Sun (to the exact date and hour). Both the Velikovskians and the
Thunderbolts people have remained completely unaware of these particular
events -- and not that both could not have been discovered among available
texts. You will not have to be able to read dead languages to find the
information.

</p><p> This cosmology can explain everything from the geology of the Earth to
the astrophysics of the Solar System. Other people have expanded on
separate facets extensively. My first concern was to provide a chronology
and a mechanics (see the Appendixes A and B). The connecting narrative
came later. In this narrative my main interest has been to trace the
origins of contemporary cultural practices. Of greatest importance, from
my point of view, is that a Saturnian cosmology provides an explanation of
the actions and thoughts of our ancestors and insight into our
contemporary behavior and thinking.

</p><p> Let me state at the outset that I have no particular axe to grind, no
politics to promote, this is not a "creationist's young earth" thesis, I
do not hold to extraterrestrial interventions, I have no religious or
theistic proposals to make, nor do I put stock in the "Elohim" of the Old
Testament. I'll remain within accepted physics -- I will not propose new
solutions to gravity or offer new "forces" for you to consider, or have
planets arbitrarily leave their orbits. And I'll use accepted dates and
dating.

</p><p> I started this essay in late 2001. I never meant to write as much as I
did, but people asked, "So what came before 4077 BC?" That alone resulted
in nine additional chapters. And then there were minor questions on items
I had never paid much attention to, like, "Why was Sirius red in
antiquity?" and "What about the two latitudes of Babylon?" This last has
been under discussion by astronomers since AD 100. But the solution is
simple.

<a name="lost-s7"></a>
 </p><h2 align="center">Mesoamerica</h2>

<p> And then, as noted directly below, I started to look at Mesoamerica,
which resulted in seven more chapters. So, after completing most of the
narrative described in these pages in March of 2006, I came across the
<i>Books of the Chilam Balam Of Chumayel</i> of the Yucatan Maya which
were written shortly after the invasion by the Spanish. These were an
attempt to secretly keep ancient myths and tales alive.

</p><p> I was astounded to find among the texts a step-by-step rendition of
the course of the "creation of the world" dating back to long before 3147
BC, followed by an accounting of other catastrophic events. The events are
described in the same detail as the parallel Egyptian and Mesopotamian
"legends." The <i>Chilam Balam</i> also provided dates which turned out to
be congruent with what had already been extracted from sources in the
Eastern Mediterranean by others. I started to include references to the
<i>Chilam Balam</i> within the main text.

</p><p> I followed up on ideas by Vincent H. Malmstrom, writing in <i>Cycles
of the Sun, Mysteries of the Moon</i> (1997), and Anthony Aveni in
<i>Skywatchers of Ancient Mexico</i> (1980), who both claim that the
Mesoamerican ceremonial sites are aligned to the setting of the solstitual
summer Sun. They are not.

</p><p> I have much better data for longitude and latitude available today
than Malmstrom and Aveni had, and found their conclusions to be completely
wrong. What I found instead, unnoticed by Malmstrom and Aveni, were
alignments to the setting of the zenithal Sun -- the day the sun exactly
overpasses a particular site, 90 degrees up in the sky. It became clear
that the location of every site in Mesoamerica was selected not only so
that the Sun would pass directly overhead (which happens two days each
year anyway), but sites were specifically selected to have the Sun set at
a mountain or in a volcano on the western or northwestern horizon. The
mountains were selected to correspond to an alignment within 1/3 degree of
this.

</p><p> I thus looked closely at 13 early and well-established ceremonial
sites in the Olmec region and the Valley of Mexico (plus two sites
elsewhere), and found that they shared some 70 alignments to mountains or
volcanoes -- each for sunsets primarily on six calendar dates only. These
are, in fact, the calendar dates associated with the four major
catastrophes identified for the Eastern Mediterranean.

</p><p> After considering sources from the Eastern Mediterranean, I was able
to tie the calendar dates to the catastrophic events of 2349 BC (September
8), 1492 BC (April 19), 747 BC (February 28), and 685 BC (three dates in
June and July).

</p><p> The dates turn out to represent the "flood of Noah" in 2349 BC (as the
culmination of the Pleiades), the Earth shock of 1492 BC (recorded in
Exodus), the shock of 747 BC (the start of the Babylonian "Era of
Nabonassar" and the Roman calendar), plus a distribution of three dates
which can be assigned to forty days of a solar nova event in June and July
of 685 BC, corresponding to the Phaethon legend.
 <a href="#lost-fn5">[note&nbsp;5]</a><a name="lost-5"></a>

</p><p>What is interesting here is that the equivalent (seasonal) calendar
dates which were found are likely to be very correct, even if the year
these events are assigned to is not. To have all the multiple alignments
of 13 sites consistently show up on 6 days only is well beyond random.
Alignments for matching calendar dates vary only by a fraction of a degree
between calculated and observed values from site to site. Among the 13
sites I looked at, there were 25 alignments assigned to the date of
September 8th, 16 to April 19th, 10 to February 28th, and 22 to three
dates in July. In all there were some 70 identical alignments used by 13
sites, plus 10 alignments for the setting Sun after an overhead (zenithal)
passage.

</p><p> Later chapters will deal with these Mesoamerican sources -- the Maya
calendar, the ending of the "First Creation" in 8347 BC, the history of
the world since the ending of the "Second Creation" of 3147 BC, the event
known as the end of the "Third Creation" of 2349 BC, the cosmological
crisis of 685 BC, the search for the "day of Kan," and an exposition of
the <i>Popol Vuh.</i>

</p><p> Within the text of the <i>Chilam Balam</i> I have identified the trees
of the four directions, the place of reeds, the crossroads or rivers in
the sky, the turtle first seen long ago, the three hearthstones in the
sky, and a number of additional phenomena.  Based on Olmec and later Maya
iconography, I have managed to identify the plumed God with the crocodile
body as well as the double-headed dragon with the Sun and Venus coming out
of its two mouths, and the sloped-walled canyon for ballgames. This seems
like the material of fantasies, but it is exactly what constitutes the
religious symbols of Mesoamerica.


<a name="index-i4"></a>
 </p><h2 align="center">Who I Am</h2>

<p> I should mention who I am, and what drove me to write this text. 

</p><p> First, I am a visual artist (sculpture, installations), living in
Chicago where I have taught photography for years. But I also have a
background in electrical engineering, cinematography, public
administration, and programming, and a curiosity dating back a lifetime.
More information is available at my website, <a href="http://jnocook.net/">[jnocook.net]</a>.

</p><p> Second, I researched and wrote this text mainly because a
comprehensive narrative of events and a plausible physical explanation
were lacking in the literature of catastrophism and alternative
cosmologies. This is a void I have been attempting to fill over the last
decade, initially for my own benefit. The text of the narrative is based
on a carefully derived chronology and a celestial mechanics which has
remained within accepted boundaries of physics.

 </p><h2 align="center">Why This Text Is Presented on the Internet</h2>

<p> This text is presented on the internet as webpages. The advantage of a
web site is that it can be easily changed, added to, corrected, and
expanded, while simultaneously having all of the ideas publicly available.
The alternative of publishing this in printed book form would delay the
availability, limit distribution to a select few, and allow no updates.
And by going public I have been forced to complete the investigation and
have been under pressure to make all of it coherent. Amazingly, additional
details keep coming forward as the edits continue.

As an antidote I recommend two books: Eric Lerner, <i>The Big Bang Never
Happened</i> (1991), and Hilton Ratcliffe, <i>The Virtue of Heresy:
Confessions of a Dissident Astronomer</i> (2007).

 <p> The culmination of a star (the Pleiades mentioned in the text) is the
date when it reaches the highest point in the sky. This would always be
directly south, and at midnight. The Pleiades culminated on the third
night after the fall equinox in 2349 BC, which occurred 15 days earlier
before 685 BC. Precession of the equinox does not apply to the era before
747 BC. The concept of the "third night" (actually two days and a night)  
is of importance in later religions. All the calendar dates are "Gregorian
equivalent" dates, apportioned over the real-time calendar days for
shorter years. These conditions will be detailed in later chapters.
